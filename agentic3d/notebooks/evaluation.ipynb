      "- The current render still does not depict a circular bowl clearly.\n",
      "- To further improve the design, consider the following suggestions:\n",
      "  - **Define the Base**: Ensure that the base of the bowl is distinct and visually different from the sides for clarity.\n",
      "  - **Ensure Symmetry**: Make sure the bowl is symmetrically shaped; an asymmetric design may not convey a bowl effectively.\n",
      "  - **Check for Thickness**: Adjust the thickness of the bowl’s material to avoid looking too flimsy or unrealistic.\n",
      "  - **Add Depth Gradients**: Introduce gradual changes in depth to enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the bowl.\n",
      "  - **Modify Viewing Angle**: Experiment with a perspective that showcases both the inside and outside of the bowl to better illustrate its form.\n",
      "  - **Smooth Transitions**: Confirm that there are no sharp edges where the base meets the sides; smooth transitions will help convey the bowl shape.\n",
      "  - **Explore Size Variations**: Test different scales for the bowl to see which dimension best fits the desired design purpose..\n",

      "- **Shape of the Handle:** The handle should be more rounded and ergonomic rather than flat; consider using a semi-circular shape.\n",
      "- **Attachment Point:** Ensure the handle connects securely to the body of the mug, possibly at the top side for easy grip.\n",
      "- **Body Curvature:** The body of the mug should have a gentle curve rather than straight sides for a more realistic appearance.\n",
      "- **Rim Design:** The rim should slightly flare out or have a curvature to enhance the mug's aesthetic and usability.\n",
      "- **Surface Texture:** Introduce a textured surface for grip on the handle, which can improve both visual appeal and functionality.\n",
      "- **Size Proportions:** Reassess the scale of the handle in relation to the body of the mug; it should be large enough to fit fingers comfortably.\n",
      "- **Interior Space:** Ensure the interior of the mug is sufficiently deep and wide for practical use, such as holding liquids.\n",
      "- **Base Stability:** Make sure the base of the mug is wider to provide stability when placed on flat surfaces.\n",
      "- **Color and Shine:** If applicable, consider adding a glaze effect or shading to simulate a ceramic finish for a lifelike appearance..\n",

      "- **Texture Addition:** Add texture or patterns to the handle to increase grip and create visual interest.\n",

      "- **Interior Depth Review:** Check the inner dimensions of the mug to ensure it can hold adequate liquids comfortably.\n",

      "- The current design is still not clearly representing a spiral staircase. Here are some additional suggestions to improve the model:\n",
      "- **Base Diameter**: Increase the diameter of the base to provide more stability and a larger surface area for the staircase.\n",
      "- **Step Design**: Include a defined profile or shape for the steps (e.g., rectangular or slightly curved) to make them more apparent and functional.\n",
      "- **Vertical Support Features**: Consider adding more details to the vertical support, such as decorative elements or additional structural supports to enhance realism.\n",
      "- **Spiral Definition**: Ensure that the spiral is more pronounced; the curve should wrap consistently around the support without too much flatness in the steps.\n",
      "- **Material Texture**: While color feedback is not allowed, consider how the material textures can convey realism; perhaps simulate wood or metal finishes if the model allows for it.\n",
      "- **Visual Balance**: Ensure that the proportion between the steps and the height of the vertical support is visually balanced for a harmonious design.\n",
      "- **Landing Space**: Think about integrating landings at intervals for practicality, especially if the staircase is to be depicted as a functional design.\n",

      "  - **Add Spires:** Incorporate pointed spires or domes to create an iconic silhouette.  \n",
      "  - **Architectural Details:** Add features like arched windows, flying buttresses, and ornate stone carvings to enhance realism.  \n",
      "  - **Cross Layout Design:** Modify the layout to reflect a traditional cross shape, including a nave and transepts.  \n",
      "  - **Large Windows:** Include large, arched or circular windows to simulate stained glass elements.  \n",
      "  - **Roof Variations:** Experiment with different roof designs, such as a gabled roof or dome, to diversify the appearance.  \n",
      "  - **Dramatic Entrance:** Design a grand entrance with decorative doors and steps that lead up to it.  \n",
      "  - **Landscaping:** Add gardens, pathways, or courtyards around the cathedral to create a welcoming atmosphere.  \n",
      "  - **Interior Details:** Consider rendering an interior perspective showing columns and vaulted ceilings.  \n",
      "  - **Decorative Elements:** Include gargoyles and ornamental details to emphasize the historical architecture.  \n",
      "  - **Complementary Structures:** Introduce adjacent buildings like a bell tower or atrium to create a more cohesive complex.  \n",
