      "  - **Leg Incorporation**: Add legs that are sturdy and support the seat; they can also feature distinctive shapes to reflect modern design trends.\n",
      "  - **Proportionality**: Ensure all elements (seat, backrest, legs) are proportionate to each other to achieve a balanced look.\n",
      "  - **Design Elements**: Explore unique design features such as cutouts or asymmetrical shapes that could enhance visual interest.\n",
